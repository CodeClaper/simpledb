-- The main reason is that the system lacking processing about large batch data deleting.
-- To be precise, only support one page (root node) data deleting and lack extention.
2. Session remove old list cause double free.
-- Maybe caused by concurrency. I have added the mutux lock at meme and it works well. 
-- But it may impact performance which is future consideration.
3. Concurrent DML operation cause system crash, lacking Concurrent lock.
4. Not free Memory after insert operation.
5. Insert into an empty table,  when key is 0, throw duplicate key error.
