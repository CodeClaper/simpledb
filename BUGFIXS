1. Batch delete (more than 1000 rows) may cause system crash.
-- The main reason is that the system lacking processing about large batch data deleting.
-- To be precise, only support one page (root node) data deleting and lack extention.
2. Session remove old list cause double free.
-- Maybe caused by concurrency. I have added the mutux lock at meme and it works well. 
-- But it may impact performance which is future consideration.
3. Concurrent DML operation cause system crash, lacking Concurrent lock.
4. Not free Memory after insert operation.
5. Insert into an empty table, when key is 0, throw duplicate key error.
6. When executing insert internal node cell, internal node splits, and update old internal key, system throw error that the pass old key and the queried old key are not equal.
-- Always remember that the internal node cell key is the max key of child node. If child is leaf, the last cell key is the max key. 
-- If child is internal, the max key exists in right chid node. When child max key has changed, the cell key in parent internal node must also be changed.
-- There four circumstances that may impact parent cell key:
-- The first, insert a new leaf node cell which greater than max key in its parent node.
-- The second, leaf node is full and split into two parts.
-- The third, insert internal node cell which greater than max key in its parent node. 
-- The forth, internal node is full and split int two parts.
